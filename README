This sketch uses a DS1810 temperature sensor in conjunction with
a heating element and fountain pump to provide a precise water bath
controller for C-41 and E-6 color film processing.

Additionally, it drives a SainSmart 1602 LCD Display with Keypad
to allow the user to select processing chemistry and act as a timer
for the various steps involved (presoak, developer, blix, etc.)

It currently supports:

- Unicolor C-41 powder kit at 96F.  This is a lower temperature
  than usual to allow a color developer time greater than
  5 minutes (times under 5 minutes can cause unevenness in tank
  processing).

- Tetenal E-6 liquid kit at standard temps and times.

- Partial support for B&W

- "Emulsion mode" which keeps the water bath at 120F for making
  homebrew gelatin emulsions.
